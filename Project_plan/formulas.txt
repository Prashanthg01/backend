Total Makespan (Days):
Makespan (hours) = (Max End Time - Min Start Time) / 3600 seconds
Makespan (days) = Makespan (hours) / 24

Average Machine Utilization (%):
Utilization = (Used Hours / Makespan Hours) × 100%

Number of Operations:
Total Operations = Count of all ProductionSchedule records

Throughput (units/day):
Throughput = Total Demand Units / Makespan (days)

Batch Size Formula:
batch_size = ceil(demand_2024 / 12)
num_batches = 12

For each batch (1 to 12), For each step in the process, Calculate Processing Time:
Total Time (seconds) = Cycle Time per Unit × Batch Size
Total Time (hours) = Total Time (seconds) / 3600
**determine start time**
Operation Start = MAX(
           Machine Available Time,    // When machine is free
           Previous Step Completion   // When previous step finishes
       )
**determine end**
Operation End = Operation Start + Total Time (hours)

- **Update Availability:**
   - Machine marked as unavailable until `Operation End`
   - Batch marked as waiting until `Operation End` (before next step)

Key points to note:
Batches don't run in parallel; they queue on machines
Each machine processes batches sequentially
This creates a linear scheduling model
