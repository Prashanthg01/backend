Technical Assessment & Recommendations for POC Development 

1. Recommended Technology Stack
 
Based on the provided requirements, the following stack is proposed:

🔹 Database Layer

SQLite → Suitable for POC (lightweight, file-based).

PostgreSQL → Recommended for production deployment (multi-user, scalable, enterprise-grade).


👉 Since you already have experience with MySQL, transitioning to PostgreSQL should be straightforward.

🔹 Backend Layer

Core Language: Python (to implement scheduling, optimization, and data handling logic).

Optimization Libraries:

Pyomo or PuLP → Mathematical optimization modeling.

Google OR-Tools → Constraint programming, scheduling, and solver integration.


Simulation (future scope): SimPy (discrete-event simulation).

Data Handling: Pandas + SQLAlchemy (for seamless database connectivity).


👉 Python will be the primary skill area to focus on.

🔹 Frontend Layer

Phase 1 – POC / Thesis:

Streamlit → Lightweight web UI for rapid prototyping.

Plotly / Matplotlib → Visualization of Gantt charts and KPIs.


Phase 2 – Enterprise:

Power BI → Business dashboards connected to PostgreSQL for management reporting.



👉 Existing knowledge of React.js + Tailwind CSS is an advantage for future custom UI development if required.

🔹 Version Control & Collaboration

Git + GitHub (already familiar).

2. Estimated Timeline for a Beginner

Assuming part-time effort and no prior Python/OR experience:

Python fundamentals → 2–3 weeks

Pandas + SQLAlchemy → 1–2 weeks

Optimization libraries (Pyomo / OR-Tools) → 3–4 weeks

POC implementation (Streamlit + SQLite) → 3–5 weeks

Testing, refinement, documentation → 1–2 weeks


⏳ Total duration: ~8–12 weeks (≈3 months) to deliver a functional POC.

3. Gaps in Current Requirements (To Clarify with Client)

To ensure alignment, the following details should be confirmed with the client:

🔹 Input Data

Do machine data, operator details, product routing, and demand forecasts already exist in structured form (Excel, ERP exports, CSV)?

What is the expected input schema/format (e.g., GSTC.xlsx)?


🔹 Output Deliverables

Should results be delivered only as a visual Gantt chart, or also as Excel/CSV exports?

Which KPIs are critical: efficiency, line balancing, utilization, tool change frequency, etc.?


🔹 Optimization Priorities

Which objective should be prioritized (e.g., maximizing throughput, minimizing setup time, reducing batch sizes)?

Should optimization goals be configurable by the end user in the UI?


🔹 Scope of POC

Is the POC limited to a single production line, or intended for entire plant scheduling?

Is the expectation only a working prototype (SQLite + Streamlit), or also an enterprise-ready solution (PostgreSQL + Power BI)?


🔹 Users & Access

Who are the target users for the POC (planners only, or also supervisors/managers)?

How many concurrent users are expected during real usage?
